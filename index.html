        <div class="subheading mb-5">Philosophy and Law</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Shannon Hegarty, and I am a first year undergraduate student at the University of California Riverside. I am studying Philosophy on a pre-law track, and love to dedicate my time to reading, writing, and holding debates in class.<br><br>

        Currently, I am the Front Desk Receptionist at LiveMetta Newport Beach Pilates. Here, I answer phone calls, emails, and texts regularly throughout my shift. I also manage the instructors' schedules, which includes group classes, private classes, breaks, etc.. When class is not going on, I clean the machines, floors, and windows to ensure that the studio always looks its best.
Previously, I was a Shift Leader at Thrive Juice Lab Newport Beach. In this position, I delegated tasks throughout the shift. I oversaw the food preparation line, the ingredient preparation line, and the front desk attendant. I also pressed juices in the morning before opening and after closing to make sure that our supply of juices was always stocked.
My first job was at Target, where I was a Customer Service Advocate and Beauty Consultant. This entailed working at the Customer Service Desk, where I would handle returns, exchanges, and purchase. I also did order pick ups here, where I would organize orders that were either drive up or in-store pickup to ensure that guests received their products in a timely manner. As a Beauty Consultant, I would back stock and stock the floor. This included makeup and skincare. I would use a Zebra machine to ensure that there is always an accurate count of products both on the floor and in the back. In my spare time, I would organize the floor to make it look aesthetic and tidy.
In the future, I am interested in pursuing law. Specifically International Law, where I can collaborate with lawyers from across the world. To prepare for this, I will be studying abroad in the Netherlands and then Ireland. This is to gain a better education of European Union Law. Following my Undergraduate experience, I hope to work in the United States and support businesses and trade. However, I am very open to exploring other fields of law. Although I am particularly interested in International Law and its fields, I would be more than happy to continue exploring throughout my educational career.<br><br>

        Other than school, I love to workout, explore nature, and spend time with my cats. I usually do Pilates at the pilates studio that I work at, and if not then I will workout from home using a Youtube instructor. I also enjoy going out in nature and exploring America's State Parks. So far, I have visited Death Valley and Joshua Tree. Finally, I love to end the day with my cats. I have four cats, whose names are Darwin, Cassie, Grizzy, and Cleo.
